# I set include = FALSE, so that all of the information about the 
# data being read in is not included when the code is run. This
# information needs not be included after it has been evaluated and 
# the data is wrangled and cleaned

# When confronted with this data, I knew that the column names would
# require extensive cleaning. I first tried to manually change each
# of the column names but found that they had similar prefixes. I 
# decided to us regular expressions and the function 
# str_replace_all to change the column names. In the future I hope 
# to be able to make this into a function as the adjustments to the
# column names for each data set is fairly repetitive. Given that
# I do not have a strong background in function writing in R, I plan # to confer with my TF about the best way to go about this.
