The link above contains the data for my project (contained in the raw-data directory), and the sample "About" page that I created for Milestone 3. I wrangled and cleaned my data in the gather.Rmd file. 

The first datasets are from nces.ed.gov (the National Center for Education Statistics). Each data set contains the admissions data from post-high-school educational institutions in the United States. This admissions data includes, the overall admission rate and the percent of undergraduate students who are members of different races (e.g. white, African American, Native American/Alaskan Natives, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Two or More Races). In addition, these datasets also include variables such as location, size of institution, level of institution, and tuition that could be used as independent variables for measuring diversity. After loading each of these datasets, I used the janitor package and the stringr package to ensure that the column names for each dataset were the same, streamlining the joining process. Then, I used the full_join() function (because the tuition variable names differed) to combine all of the year datasets into a larger data set containing the information from 2010 to 2018. 
My second source of data is the 2010 census data from the r tidycensus package. As of last week, I planned to use census data from census.gov. Instead, I decided to the tidycensus r package data because not only was it already wrangled, it also contains geometry data for each of the states in case I want to create plots using the sf geom.
Using these datasets I hope to create scatterplots showing the correlation between institution characteristics (e.g institution size or state populations) to discover what items correlate to diversity at these institutions.
